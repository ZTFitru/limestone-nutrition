            Our History
          </p>
          <p className="text-md leading-relaxed">
            Established in 2012.
            Shannon and Drew Townsend are the owners of Limestone Nutrition. Shannon has lost 80 pounds and Drew has gained 20 pounds of muscle. 
            We are committed and dedicated health coaches who want to show people a healthy active lifestyle. We also have an Opportunity Meeting 
            every Tuesday night at 7pm for those interested in becoming a Health & Wellness Coach and earning extra income! We were previously located on 
            Limestone Road next to Buffalo Wild Wings. They will be turning that space into an office for Bank of America Summer 2015, so we found a prime 
            location across the street! We are now at 4569 Kirkwood Highway in MillCreek Shopping Center next to Crossroads Restaurant. Bigger space & more 
            parking! We have the best coaches here to help you towards your health goals and each coach has had their own incredible health result on the 
            products. Our coaches attend meetings and training's to best serve you! Thank you for your support.
